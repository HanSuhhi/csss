# Motivation

Overall, I just want to build a component lib by myself.

## Cause

Simply put, in many of my small projects (really very, very small projects), there are often three contradictions.

* No need to import an entire UI library.
* Native components are not beautiful.
* I'm lazy to redesign components.

So, I want to design a native-based, without unsightly, simplest component library.

Personal feelings.

## Preference

Meanwhile, I also really like [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).Many of my projects, my reliance on CSS custom properties even exceeds the reliance on sass, less, postcss.

Maybe if i have a lib about CSS custom properties. I could save a lot of effort.

:::tip
Sass, Less and Postcss also provide a solution about CSS variables.It's all a way to write a good code, there is no **best**.

## Future

Finally, I hope this lib just a basic lib that every css behavior can rewrite this.Just like I hope it could rewrite origin style üçâ
