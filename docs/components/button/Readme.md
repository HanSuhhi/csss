# Button

A necessary component.

:::tip
When I see a button appear on the screen.It's look like seeing "hello world" printed on the terminal.
:::

## Color Style ðŸŽ¨

Color Styles are differentiated according to two types of needs: **business** and **colorful**

### Business

Business Color Style will focus on the linkage with other components.You can control it by using `tobe` attribute.

<demo src="./ButtonTobe.vue" title="Color Style" desc="Works well despite the fixed color" />

### Colorful

Colorful style provides more color presets.You can set `color` attribute to use it.More details can be found [Attribute Total](./#Attributes)

<demo src="./ButtonColor.vue" title="Color Style" desc="The world is not black or white." />

:::warning
Style generated by `color` attribute will cover `tobe` attribute.
:::

## Secondary Button

A secondary Button controlled via the `secondary` attibute.

<demo src="./ButtonSecondary.vue" title="Secondary Button" desc="Secondary buttons sometimes are necessary." />

## Disabled

Just like html, using `disabled` attribute to disable the button.

<demo src="./ButtonDisabled.vue" title="Disabled" desc="This equipment has too low durability to be used." />

## Size

Only 2 sizes are supported.More sizes will be avaliable later.

<demo src="./ButtonSize.vue" title="Button Size" desc="There are always some big kids and some little kids in a classroom." />

## Dashed Button

You may need some dashed button in some scenes.

<demo src="./ButtonDashed.vue" title="Dashed Button" />

## Dark Mode(TODO)

In my schema, dark mode need to be linked with other components.However, other components haven't been born yet.

:::tip
Still need a time.
